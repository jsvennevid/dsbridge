DSBridge
--------

DSBridge is a small wrapper application that redirects the DirectSound API
(only basic DirectSound currently) and exposes the playing stream as an
MP3 stream with metadata.

Dependencies
------------

* lame_enc.dll (I developed this using 3.98.2) - NOT INCLUDED

Usage
-----

Drop dsound.dll along with listed dependencies in the same folder as the
program you want to wrap and start it. After music playback has been initiated,
point your MP3 playback software to http://localhost:8124/ and hopefully you
should hear music playing.

To assist you, when you start playing a small icon will appear in the systray.
This icon will be either blue (server is idle), green (somebody is connected),
yellow (warning) or red (error). It also displays the URL to listen in the
tooltip text.

If you cannot get your software to connect to the stream, you might have
to specify your IP address explicitly (this behaviour has been seen with
SqueezeCenter even when you are running it locally). Then just specify
http://ip.add.re.ss:8124/ and it should play happily.

Issues
------

* MP3 stream does not support multiple listeners, so connecting more than one
listener will sound... strange.

* Currently no format conversion takes place, so if the wrapped software
plays using something else than 44.1kHz stereo the encoder will not output a
proper stream.


Todo
----

* DirectSoundBuffer8 support
* Add configuration capabilities
* Stabilize streaming support
* Improve HTTP server
